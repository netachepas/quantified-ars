Hi, my name is Joe. I run 4.1  miles a day at a 7:52 mile clip and I  sleep 6.6 hours a night at 55.4 percent deep sleep. I have 435 friends, 1359  followers, and 1267 connections. I  went to 136 places in 24 cities last  year, and I drove an average of  32.6 miles a day to get there at 42.2  miles per hour. In the last 30  days, I answered 28 questions, read 121  articles, and wrote another 12.  I currently rank number 7 in cool points, but  also number 3 in douchebaggery.
